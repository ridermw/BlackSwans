## üìå Tips Inspired by AI Agent Best Practices

* **Write goals clearly and simply**‚Äîagents operate best with well-defined objectives and constraints ([techradar.com](https://www.techradar.com/computing/artificial-intelligence/5-ways-chatgpt-agent-can-change-the-way-you-use-ai?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [github.com](https://github.com/e2b-dev/awesome-ai-agents?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [help.webex.com](https://help.webex.com/en-us/article/nelkmxk/Guidelines-and-best-practices-for-automating-with-AI-agent?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_agent?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [wsj.com](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-are-companies-using-ai-agents-heres-a-look-at-five-early-users-of-the-bots-26f87845?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [lindy.ai](https://www.lindy.ai/blog/ai-agents-examples?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).
* **Structure tasks hierarchically**‚Äîbreak down complex tasks into atomic steps agents can follow reliably ([analyticsvidhya.com](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2023/12/10-ways-to-automate-your-tasks-using-autonomous-ai-agents/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [willowtreeapps.com](https://www.willowtreeapps.com/craft/building-ai-agents-with-plan-and-execute?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).
* **Include priority, time estimate, and dependencies** so agents can plan and manage resources effectively ([reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1fwzi71/using_chatgpt_to_schedule_my_day_remember_my/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).
* **Maintain human oversight**, especially on tasks that involve permissions or financial data ([techradar.com](https://www.techradar.com/computing/artificial-intelligence/5-ways-chatgpt-agent-can-change-the-way-you-use-ai?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

### ‚úÖ Summary

This `todo.md` format transforms a simple checklist into an operational specification:

* **Tasks are explicitly actionable**‚Äîwith input/output definitions.
* **Sub‚Äësteps guide execution**, reducing ambiguity.
* **Timing and deliverables** support automation orchestration.
* **Built-in governance and feedback loops** ensure quality and alignment.

From here, ChatGPT Agents‚Äîor human simulators‚Äîcan pick up tasks autonomously, track progress, and escalate when needed. Let me know if you‚Äôd like a JSON schema version or templates tailored to Obsidian, GitHub Projects, or direct ChatGPT Agent prompting!
